## Overview

ZapTok is an open-sourced, decentralized video platform powered by Bitcoin ‚Äî built using the MKStack platform framework on the open Nostr protocol.

We deliver censorship-resistant content sharing with lightning-fast Bitcoin tips (aka zaps), giving creators and users complete control over their data and earnings. Experience familiar social media with true ownership and privacy - where your content and earnings are actually yours.

## Philosophy

ZapTok believes in:
- **Self sovereignty**: Users own their data, identity, and monetary interactions - no intermediaries, no gatekeepers
- **Creator-first economy**: Tools and features that empower creators to monetize directly without middlemen taking a cut
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with other Nostr apps and services for a unified user experience
- **Open source**: Transparent, auditable code that the community can verify and improve
- **Privacy by design**: Built-in privacy protections, not afterthoughts or add-ons
- **Censorship resistance**: Decentralized architecture with no single point of failure or control 



## How ZapTok's Protocol Integration Benefits You:

For Creators:
Own Your Brand & Earnings

- Keep your identity and follower relationships (Nostr) - no platform can delete you
- Receive instant Bitcoin tips (aka lightning zaps in satoshis) with zero platform fees
- Get paid 24/7 from a global audience without banking restrictions
- Build once, publish everywhere - your content works across Nostr apps
- No chargebacks or payment reversals on zaps received
  
For Viewers/Fans:
True Privacy & Control

- Watch and interact without giving up personal data
- Tip creators directly with pseudo-anonymous Bitcoin zap payments
- Your viewing history and preferences stay private by design
- Access content that can't be censored or geo-blocked
- Use the same identity across all Nostr-compatible apps
  
For Everyone:
Bulletproof & Transparent

- No single company can shut down the network or your account
- Open source code - verify security and suggest improvements
- Real-time interactions without corporate algorithms deciding what you see
- Global access - works the same no matter the location as long as you have internet access 
- Your posts and social connections are portable between platforms

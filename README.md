</details>

### Overview & Features

<details>
<summary><strong>How is ZapTok different from TikTok or YouTube?</strong></summary>

**ZapTok (Decentralized Nostr client)**
- You own your account and data
- Zero client fees on earnings
- No algorithmic content manipulation
- Censorship-resistant
- Privacy-focused
- Works across all Nostr apps
- Open source code

**Centralized Platforms**
- Platform owns your account
- 30-50% platform fees
- Algorithm controls what you see
- Can ban or shadow-ban at will
- Data harvesting and tracking
- Walled garden (platform-locked)
- Proprietary code

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I keep all my earnings?</strong></summary>

Yes! Zaps are sent directly to YOUR Lightning or Cashu wallet address. ZapTok never holds your funds—payments go straight from the sender to your wallet in seconds. You control the keys, you control the money. There's no platform custody, no withdrawal requests, and no waiting periods. Just pure peer-to-peer payments with zero fees deducted.

Want to convert to on-chain Bitcoin? Use [Boltz.exchange](https://boltz.exchange) for non-custodial atomic swaps to your Bitcoin wallet, or custodial services like [Strike](https://strike.me) or [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com) that handle the conversion for you.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can my account be deleted or banned?</strong></summary>

No. Your Nostr identity and social connections are yours forever. Because ZapTok is built on the decentralized Nostr protocol, no single company can delete your account, ban you, or remove your followers. Your identity is cryptographically secured by your private key.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does my content work on other Nostr platforms?</strong></summary>

Absolutely! Your videos, profile, and social connections work across all Nostr-compatible apps. Post on ZapTok, and your content is accessible through Amethyst, Damus, Primal, and hundreds of other Nostr clients. Build your audience once, reach them everywhere.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can ZapTok be shut down?</strong></summary>

ZapTok as a nostr client is part of a decentralized nostr ecosystem, so there's no single point of failure. Even if ZapTok.social went offline tomorrow, your content and social connections would remain accessible through other Nostr relays and clients. The network of relays ensures your data persists independently of any single service.

</details>

### Privacy & Payments

<details>
<summary><strong>Is my viewing history private?</strong></summary>

Yes. Your viewing history and preferences stay completely private by design. Unlike centralized platforms that track and sell your data, ZapTok doesn't collect or store your browsing behavior. You watch, you interact, you move on - no data harvesting.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Are there payment restrictions or chargebacks?</strong></summary>

No restrictions or chargebacks! Lightning zaps are:
- **Instant** - Creators receive payments in seconds
- **Global** - No banking restrictions or geographic limitations
- **Final** - No chargebacks or payment reversals
- **24/7** - Get paid anytime from anyone, anywhere

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I tip creators anonymously?</strong></summary>

Zaps offer pseudo-anonymous payments. While Lightning transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain, they're not directly tied to your real-world identity. For even more privacy, use Cashu Nutzaps - our eCash integration that provides enhanced privacy for peer-to-peer payments.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can content be censored or geo-blocked?</strong></summary>

Content on Nostr is censorship-resistant. Because videos and data are distributed across multiple independent relays (not a single company's servers), content can't be easily censored or geo-blocked. If one relay removes content, it remains accessible through other relays.

</details>

### Technical Details

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the code open source?</strong></summary>

Yes! ZapTok is fully open source under the AGPL-3.0 license. You can:
- Review the code for security and privacy
- Verify there are no backdoors or tracking
- Suggest improvements or contribute features
- Fork and run your own instance

Transparency builds trust.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What are relays and why do they matter?</strong></summary>

Relays are servers that store and distribute Nostr events (posts, videos, profiles). Unlike centralized platforms with one company server, Nostr uses multiple independent relays:

- **Redundancy** - Your content lives on multiple relays
- **Censorship resistance** - If one relay removes content, others keep it
- **User choice** - You pick which relays to use
- **No single point of failure** - The network stays online even if relays go down

You can configure which relays to use in ZapTok's settings.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need multiple accounts for different Nostr apps?</strong></summary>

No! One Nostr identity works everywhere. Your same npub (Nostr public key) logs you into ZapTok, Damus, Amethyst, Primal, and every other Nostr app. Your followers, content, and settings follow you across the entire Nostr ecosystem.

</details>

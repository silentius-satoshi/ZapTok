# Lightning Invoice Enhancement Implementation

## Overview
We've successfully implemented an enhanced Lightning invoice display system for ZapTok that provides professional invoice preview, decoding, and payment capabilities for both WebLN and Cashu payment methods.

## Components Added

### 1. LightningInvoice Component (`/src/components/LightningInvoice.tsx`)
A comprehensive Lightning invoice display component with three variants:
- **Default**: Full invoice preview with QR code, amount, description, and payment controls
- **Compact**: Minimal inline display perfect for lists or feeds
- **Detailed**: Extended view with payment hash, timestamps, and technical details

**Features:**
- Real-time expiry countdown timer
- QR code generation and display
- Amount formatting with thousands separators
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Payment method agnostic design
- Error handling for invalid invoices

### 2. Lightning Invoice Utilities (`/src/lib/lightning-invoice.ts`)
Core utility functions for invoice processing:
- **decodeLightningInvoice()**: Parses bolt11 invoices using light-bolt11-decoder
- **formatSats()**: Human-readable amount formatting
- **generateInvoiceQR()**: QR code generation using qrcode library
- **Time calculation helpers**: Expiry tracking and countdown

### 3. Enhanced QuickZap Integration
Updated the existing QuickZap modal to include:
- Invoice preview before payment
- Seamless integration with both WebLN and Cashu workflows
- Professional invoice display using the new LightningInvoice component
- Back navigation between zap setup and invoice preview

### 4. Demo Component (`/src/components/LightningInvoiceDemo.tsx`)
Showcases all component variants and capabilities for testing and development.

## Dependencies Added
- `light-bolt11-decoder`: Lightning invoice parsing
- `qrcode` + `@types/qrcode`: QR code generation

## Integration Points

### WebLN Flow Enhancement
1. User initiates zap via QuickZap modal
2. System requests invoice from Lightning provider
3. **NEW**: Invoice preview modal displays with decoded information
4. User reviews amount, expiry, QR code before confirming
5. Payment executes via WebLN on confirmation

### Cashu Flow Compatibility
The same LightningInvoice component works for Cashu payments, providing consistent UX across payment methods.

- Parses bolt11 invoices to extract amount, description, expiry
- Handles millisat to sat conversion
- Graceful error handling for invalid invoices

### ‚è±Ô∏è Real-time Expiry Tracking

- Automatic expiry detection
- Visual indicators for expired invoices

### üì± QR Code Generation
- High-quality QR codes using industry-standard qrcode library
- Error correction level M for reliability
- Fallback SVG placeholder for generation failures

### üé® Professional UI
- Three responsive variants for different use cases
- Consistent with existing ZapTok design system
- Dark theme optimized

## Usage Examples

```tsx
// Full invoice preview
<LightningInvoice
  invoice={invoiceString}
  onPay={handlePayment}
  variant="default"
  showQR={true}
  showPayButton={true}
/>

// Compact display for feeds
<LightningInvoice
  invoice={invoiceString}
  variant="compact"
  showQR={false}
/>

// Detailed technical view
<LightningInvoice
  invoice={invoiceString}
  variant="detailed"
  showQR={true}
/>
```

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can now review Lightning invoices before payment
2. **Professional Appearance**: Matches the quality of leading Lightning apps like Primal
3. **Payment Method Agnostic**: Works seamlessly with WebLN and Cashu
4. **Developer Friendly**: Reusable components with clear APIs
5. **Error Resilient**: Graceful handling of invalid invoices and network issues

## Testing
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration with existing QuickZap workflow
- Build verification completed successfully

This implementation brings ZapTok's Lightning payment experience to professional standards while maintaining compatibility with the existing hybrid WebLN/Cashu system.

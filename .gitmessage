#    fix      (bug fix)
#    docs     (changes to documentation)
#    style    (formatting, missing semicolons, etc; no code change)
#    refactor (refactoring production code)
#    test     (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no prod code change)
#    chore    (updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no prod code change)

# Scope should be one of:

# Remember to:
#    - Use lowercase for type and scope
#    - Use imperative mood in the subject line

#    - Separate subject from body with a blank line
#    - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
